> A Federated Knowledge Core for astronomical research — decoupling semantic meaning from structural relationships to enable expert-level RAG and autonomous Deep Research agents.

This repository builds a specialized knowledge corpus from astronomical literature, designed to support Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for the DESI research portfolio. The system grounds LLM responses in verifiable scientific data, preserves citation topology, and enables multi-step research workflows through Claude Code and MCP integration.

---

## 🔭 Background

Building a scientific RAG system extends far beyond document aggregation. Astronomical literature contains complex mathematical notation, specialized terminology, and a rapidly evolving research landscape. Most critically, an AI agent for scientific discovery cannot operate on ambiguous information — its knowledge must be traceable, accurate, and contextually rich.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses LLM hallucination by grounding responses in retrieved documents. Standard RAG retrieves semantically similar text chunks, but scientific questions often require understanding *how papers relate* — which work refutes another, who the key authors are, what foundational papers underpin a claim.

This system implements a Federated Knowledge Core that separates:

- What papers say (semantic content via embeddings)
- How papers connect (citation topology via graph)
- Where artifacts live (physical storage for reproducibility)

The architecture enables "Graph-Boosted Retrieval" — semantic search results refined by citation topology. A query about "DESI void galaxy quenching" retrieves relevant chunks, then expands context to include highly-cited foundational papers that may not semantically match but are topologically indispensable.

## 🎯 Research Portfolio

This corpus supports the Proxmox Astronomy Lab's DESI research portfolio:

| Project | Focus | Corpus Role |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| [desi-cosmic-void-galaxies](https://github.com/Proxmox-Astronomy-Lab/desi-cosmic-void-galaxies) | Environmental quenching, ARD factory | Primary consumer — void science literature |
| [desi-qso-anomaly-detection](https://github.com/Proxmox-Astronomy-Lab/desi-qso-anomaly-detection) | ML anomaly detection on QSO spectra | QSO/AGN methodology papers |
| [desi-quasar-outflows](https://github.com/Proxmox-Astronomy-Lab/desi-quasar-outflows) | AGN feedback and outflow energetics | Outflow physics literature |

Seed corpus focus: DESIVAST (void catalog methodology) — central to all three projects.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Federated Knowledge Core

The system decouples content from context, bridged by NASA ADS Bibcode as the universal key.

### Corpus Quality Hierarchy

Data sources prioritized by structure, fidelity, and reliability:

| Level | Source | Content | Fidelity |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|
| 1 | DESI, SIMBAD, VizieR | Structured catalog data | Ground truth |
| 2 | FITS Headers | Observational metadata | Instrument provenance |
| 3 | arXiv LaTeX | Clean text from source | High fidelity |
| 4 | PDF Extraction | Text from rendered documents | Best effort |

LaTeX-first extraction is critical — PDF-to-text conversion corrupts mathematical notation, mangles equations, and introduces OCR artifacts that poison the embedding space.

## 📋 Implementation Phases

| Phase | Name | Status | Description |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| 01 | [Ideation and Setup](work-logs/01-ideation-and-setup/README.md) | ✅ Complete | GDR review, repo initialization |
| 02 | Plan Review | ⬜ Next | Validate seed corpus against 2026 research priorities |
| 03 | Foundation | ⬜ Planned | Walking skeleton: single paper → retrieval loop |
| 04 | Harvester | ⬜ Planned | ADS/arXiv acquisition, seed corpus population |
| 05 | Hybrid Engine | ⬜ Planned | Neo4j graph construction, hybrid retrieval |
| 06 | Agent | ⬜ Planned | LangGraph state machine, multi-step research |
| 07 | Interface | ⬜ Planned | MCP servers, Claude Code integration |

### Walking Skeleton (Phase 03)

The minimal end-to-end loop proving the architecture:

```
arXiv ID → download source → LaTeX extraction → clean text + bibcode → PostgreSQL → semantic query → return with attribution
```

No catalog integration, no Neo4j, no MCP — just the text pipeline.

## 🖥️ Infrastructure

This project runs on the [Proxmox Astronomy Lab](https://github.com/Proxmox-Astronomy-Lab/proxmox-astronomy-lab) research cluster.

| Component | Resource | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| PostgreSQL + pgvector | radio-pgsql01 (10.25.20.8) | Semantic layer, embeddings, vector search |
| Neo4j | radio-neo4j01 (10.25.20.21) | Topological layer, citation graphs |
| SMB Storage | radio-fs02 (10.25.20.15) | Physical layer, PDF/LaTeX artifacts |
| GPU | radio-gpu01 (A4000, 16GB) | Embedding generation |
| Database | `astronomy_rag_corpus` | Dedicated corpus database |

Connection patterns follow the standard `/opt/global-env/research.env` configuration.
